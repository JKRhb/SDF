  Semantic Definition Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions of Things
                       draft-ietf-asdf-sdf-latest

Abstract

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   in the Internet of Things.  An SDF specification describes
   definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events,
   Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types for the information
   exchanged in those interactions.  Tools convert this format to
   database formats and other serializations as needed.


   // A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in version
   // (-00) of this document; version (-05) was designated as an
   // _implementation draft_, labeled SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of
   // the ASDF WG (2021-03-11).  The present version (-12) collects
   // smaller changes up to 2022-06-30.  It also removes deprecated
   // elements from SDF 1.0.

1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   in the Internet of Things.  An SDF specification describes
   definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events,
   Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types for the information
   exchanged in those interactions.  Tools convert this format to
   database formats and other serializations as needed.


   // A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in version
   // (-00) of this document; version (-05) was designated as an
   // _implementation draft_, labeled SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of
   // the ASDF WG (2021-03-11).  The present version (-12) collects
   // smaller changes up to 2022-06-30.  It also removes deprecated
   // elements from SDF 1.0.

1.1.  Terminology and Conventions

   Thing:  A physical item that is also made available in the Internet
      of Things.  The term is used here for Things that are notable for
      their interaction with the physical world beyond interaction with
      humans; a temperature sensor or a light might be a Thing, but a
      router that employs both temperature sensors and indicator lights
      might exhibit less Thingness, as the effects of its functioning
      are mostly on the digital side.

   Affordance:  An element of an interface offered for interaction,
      defining its possible uses or making clear how it can or should be
      used.  The term is used here for the digital interfaces of a Thing
      only; it might also have physical affordances such as buttons,
      dials, and displays.

   Quality:  A metadata item in a definition or declaration which says
      something about that definition or declaration.  A quality is
      represented in SDF as an entry in a JSON map (object) that serves
      as a definition or declaration.

   Entry:  A key-value pair in a map.  (In JSON maps, sometimes also
      called "member".)

   Block:  One or more entries in a JSON map that is part of an SDF
      specification; these entries together serve a specific function.

   Group:  An entry in the main SDF map and in certain nested
      definitions that has a Class Name Keyword as its key and a map of
      definition entries (Definition Group) as a value.

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


   Class Name Keyword:  One of sdfThing, sdfObject, sdfProperty,
      sdfAction, sdfEvent, or sdfData; the Classes for these type
      keywords are capitalized and prefixed with sdf.

   Class:  Abstract term for the information that is contained in groups
      identified by a Class Name Keyword.

   Property:  An affordance that can potentially be used to read, write,
      and/or observe state on an Object.  (Note that Entries are often
      called properties in other environments; in this document, the
      term Property is specifically reserved for affordances, even if
      the map key "properties" might be imported from a data definition
      language with the other semantics.)

   Action:  An affordance that can potentially be used to perform a
      named operation on an Object.

   Event:  An affordance that can potentially be used to obtain
      information about what happened to an Object.

   Object:  A grouping of Property, Action, and Event definitions; the
      main "atom" of reusable semantics for model construction.  Objects
      are similar to Things but do not allow nesting, i. e. they cannot
      contain other Objects or Things.  (Note that JSON maps are often
      called JSON objects due to JSON's JavaScript heritage; in this
      document, the term Object is specifically reserved for the above
      grouping, even if the type name "object" might be imported from a
      data definition language with the other semantics.)

   Element:  A part or an aspect of something abstract; used here in its
      usual English definition.  (Occasionally, also used specifically
      for the elements of JSON arrays.)

   Definition:  An entry in a Definition Group; the entry creates a new
      semantic term for use in SDF models and associates it with a set
      of qualities.

   Declaration:  A reference to and a use of a definition within an
      enclosing definition, intended to create component instances
      within that enclosing definition.  Every declaration can also be
      used as a definition for reference in a different place.

   Protocol Binding:  A companion document to an SDF specification that
      defines how to map the abstract concepts in the specification into
      the protocols in use in a specific ecosystem.  Might supply URL
      components, numeric IDs, and similar details.

   The term "byte" is used in its now-customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   Conventions:

   *  The singular form is chosen as the preferred one for the keywords
      defined here.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

2.1.  Example Definition

   We start with an example for the SDF definition of a simple Object
   called "Switch" (Figure 1).

         },
         "sdfAction": {
           "on": {
             "description": "Turn the switch on; equivalent to setting value to true."
           },
           "off": {
             "description": "Turn the switch off; equivalent to setting value to false."
           },
           "toggle": {
             "description": "Toggle the switch; equivalent to setting value to its complement."
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

            Figure 1: A simple example of an SDF definition file

   This is a model of a switch.  The state value declared in the
   sdfProperty group, represented by a Boolean, will be true for "on"
   and will be false for "off".  The actions on or off declared in the
   sdfAction group are redundant with setting the value and are in the
   example to illustrate that there are often different ways of
   achieving the same effect.  The action toggle will invert the value
   of the sdfProperty value, so that 2-way switches can be created;
   having such action will avoid the need for first retrieving the
   current value and then applying/setting the inverted value.

   The sdfObject group lists the affordances of instances of this
   object.  The sdfProperty group lists the property affordances
   described by the model; these represent various perspectives on the
   state of the object.  Properties can have additional qualities to
   describe the state more precisely.  Properties can be annotated to be
   read, write or read/write; how this is actually done by the
   underlying transfer protocols is not described in the SDF model but
   left to companion protocol bindings.  Properties are often used with
   RESTful paradigms [I-D.irtf-t2trg-rest-iot], describing state.  The
   sdfAction group is the mechanism to describe other interactions in
   terms of their names, input, and output data (no data are used in the
   example), as in a POST method in REST or in a remote procedure call.
   The example toggle is an Action that changes the state based on the
   current state of the Property named value.  (The third type of
   affordance is Events, which are not described in this example.)

   In the JSON representation, note how (with the exception of the info
   group) maps that have keys taken from the SDF vocabulary (info,
   namespace, sdfObject) alternate in nesting with maps that have keys
   that are freely defined by the model writer (Switch, value, on,
   etc.); the latter usually use the named<> production in the formal
   syntax of SDF (Appendix A), while the former SDF-defined vocabulary
   items are often, but not always, called _qualities_.

2.2.  Elements of an SDF model

   The SDF language uses six predefined Class Name Keywords for modeling
   connected Things which are illustrated in Figure 2.

                 Figure 2: Main classes used in SDF models

   The six main Class Name Keywords are discussed below.

2.2.1.  sdfObject

   Objects, the items listed in an sdfObject group, are the main "atom"
   of reusable semantics for model construction.  It aligns in scope
   with common definition items from many IoT modeling systems, for
   example ZigBee Clusters [ZCL], OMA SpecWorks LwM2M Objects [OMA], and
   OCF Resource Types [OCF].

   An sdfObject contains a set of sdfProperty, sdfAction, and sdfEvent
   definitions that describe the interaction affordances associated with
   some scope of functionality.

   For the granularity of definition, sdfObject definitions are meant to
   be kept narrow enough in scope to enable broad reuse and
   interoperability.  For example, defining a light bulb using separate
   sdfObject definitions for on/off control, dimming, and color control
   affordances will enable interoperable functionality to be configured
   for diverse product types.  An sdfObject definition for a common on/
   off control may be used to control may different kinds of Things that
   require on/off control.

   Optional qualities "minItems" and "maxItems" can be used to define
   sdfObjects as arrays.

2.2.2.  sdfProperty

   sdfProperty is used to model elements of state within sdfObject
   instances.

   An instance of sdfProperty may be associated with some protocol
   affordance to enable the application to obtain the state variable
   and, optionally, modify the state variable.  Additionally, some
   protocols provide for in-time reporting of state changes.  (These
   three aspects are described by the qualities readable, writable, and
   observable defined for an sdfProperty.)

   Definitions in sdfProperty groups include the definitions from
   sdfData groups, however, they actually also declare a Property with
   the given qualities to be potentially present in the containing
   Object.

   For definitions in sdfProperty and sdfData, SDF provides qualities
   that can constrain the structure and values of data allowed in an
   instance of these data, as well as qualities that associate semantics
   to these data, for engineering units and unit scaling information.

   For the data definition within sdfProperty or sdfData, SDF borrows
   some vocabulary proposed for the drafts 4 and 7 of the json-
   schema.org "JSON Schema" format (collectively called JSO here),
   enhanced by qualities that are specific to SDF.  Details about the
   former are in Appendix C.  For the current version of SDF, data are
   constrained to be of simple types (number, string, Boolean), JSON
   maps composed of named data ("objects"), and arrays of these types.
   Syntax extension points are provided that can be used to provide
   richer types in future versions of this specification (possibly more
   of which can be borrowed from json-schema.org).

   Note that sdfProperty definitions (and sdfData definitions in
   general) are not intended to constrain the formats of data used for
   communication over network interfaces.  Where needed, data
   definitions for payloads of protocol messages are expected to be part
   of the protocol binding.

2.2.3.  sdfAction

   The sdfAction group contains declarations of Actions, model
   affordances that, when triggered, have more effect than just reading,
   updating, or observing Thing state, often resulting in some outward
   physical effect (which, itself, cannot be modeled in SDF).  From a
   programmer's perspective, they might be considered to be roughly
   analogous to method calls.

   Actions may have data parameters; these are modeled as a single item
   of input data and output data, each.  (Where multiple parameters need
   to be modeled, an "object" type can be used to combine these
   parameters into one.)  Actions may be long-running, that is to say
   that the effects may not take place immediately as would be expected
   for an update to an sdfProperty; the effects may play out over time
   and emit action results.  Actions may also not always complete and
   may result in application errors, such as an item blocking the
   closing of an automatic door.

   Actions may have (or lack) qualities of idempotency and side-effect
   safety.

   The current version of SDF only provides data constraint modeling and
   semantics for the input and output data of definitions in sdfAction
   groups.  Again, data definitions for payloads of protocol messages,
   and detailed protocol settings for invoking the action, are expected
   to be part of the protocol binding.

2.2.4.  sdfEvent

   The sdfEvent group contains declarations of Events, which can model
   affordances that inform about "happenings" associated with an
   instance of an Object; these may result in a signal being stored or
   emitted as a result.

   Note that there is a trivial overlap with sdfProperty state changes,
   which may also be defined as events but are not generally required to
   be defined as such.  However, Events may exhibit certain ordering,
   consistency, and reliability requirements that are expected to be
   supported in various implementations of sdfEvent that do distinguish
   sdfEvent from sdfProperty.  For instance, while a state change may
   simply be superseded by another state change, some events are
   "precious" and need to be preserved even if further events follow.

   The current version of SDF only provides data constraint modeling and
   semantics for the output data of Event affordances.  Again, data
   definitions for payloads of protocol messages, and detailed protocol
   settings for invoking the action, are expected to be part of the
   protocol binding.

2.2.5.  sdfData

   Definitions in sdfData groups are provided separately from those in
   sdfProperty groups to enable common modeling patterns, data
   constraints, and semantic anchor concepts to be factored out for data
   items that make up sdfProperty items and serve as input and output
   data for sdfAction and sdfEvent items.

   It is a common use case for such a data definition to be shared
   between an sdfProperty item and input or output parameters of an
   sdfAction or output data provided by an sdfEvent. sdfData definitions
   also enable factoring out extended application data types such as
   mode and machine state enumerations to be reused across multiple
   definitions that have similar basic characteristics and requirements.

2.2.6.  sdfThing

   Back at the top level, the sdfThing groups enables definition of
   models for complex devices that will use one or more sdfObject
   definitions. sdfThing groups, however, also allow for including
   interaction affordances, sdfData, as well as minItems and maxItems
   qualities.  Therefore, they can be seen as a superset of sdfObject
   groups, additionally allowing for composition.

   A definition in an sdfThing group can refine the metadata of the
   definitions it is composed from: other definitions in sdfThing groups
   definitions in sdfObject groups.

2.3.  Member names: Given Names and Quality Names

   SDF models are JSON objects (maps) that mostly employ JSON objects as
   member values, which in turn mostly employ JSON objects as their
   member values, and so on.  This nested structure of JSON objects
   creates a tree, where the edges are the member names (map keys) used
   in these JSON objects.  (In certain cases, where member names are not
   needed, JSON arrays may be interspersed in this tree.)

2.3.1.  Given Names and Quality Names

   For any particular JSON object in an SDF model, the set of member
   names that are used is either of:




Koster & Bormann         Expires 1 January 2023                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


   *  A set of "_Quality Names_", where the entries in the object are
      Qualities.  Quality Names are defined by the present specification
      and its extensions, together with specific semantics to be
      associated with the member value given with a certain Quality
      Name.

   *  A set of "_Given Names_", where the entries in the object are
      separate entities (definitions, declarations, etc.) that each have
      names that are chosen by the SDF model author in order that these
      names can be employed by a user of that model.

   In a path from the root of the tree to any leaf, Quality Names and
   Given Names roughly alternate (with the information block,
   Section 3.1, as a prominent exception).

   The meaning of the JSON object that is the member value associated
   with a Given Name is derived from the Quality Name that was used as
   the member name associated to the parent.  In the CDDL grammar given
   in Appendix A, JSON objects with member names that are Given Names
   are defined using the CDDL generic rule reference
   named<objectmembers>, where objectmembers is in turn the structure of
   the members of the JSON object that is the value of the member named
   by the Given Name.  As quality-named objects and given-named objects
   roughly alternate in a path down the tree, objectmembers is usually
   an object built from Quality Names.

2.3.2.  Hierarchical Names

   From the outside of a specification, Given Names are usually used as
   part of a hierarchical name that looks like a JSON pointer [RFC6901],
   itself generally rooted in (used as the fragment identifier in) an
   outer namespace that looks like an https:// URL (see Section 4).

   As Quality Names and Given Names roughly alternate in a path into the
   model, the JSON pointer part of the hierarchical name also alternates
   between Quality Names and Given Names.

2.3.3.  Extensibility of Given Names and Quality Names

   In SDF, both Quality Names and Given Names are _extension points_.
   This is more obvious for Quality Names: Extending SDF is mostly done
   by defining additional qualities.  To enable non-conflicting third
   party extensions to SDF, an extension is planned that will allow the
   use of qualified names (names with an embedded colon) as Quality
   Names.  Until that extension is defined, Quality Names with (one or
   more) embedded colons are reserved and MUST NOT be used in an SDF
   model.

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


   Further, to enable Given Names to have a more powerful role in
   building global hierarchical names, an extension is planned that
   makes use of qualified names for Given Names.  So, until that
   extension is defined, Given Names with (one or more) embedded colons
   are reserved and MUST NOT be used in an SDF model.

3.  SDF structure

   SDF definitions are contained in SDF files.  One or more SDF files
   can work together to provide the definitions and declarations that
   are the payload of the SDF format.

   An SDF definition file contains a single JSON map (JSON object).
   This object has three blocks: the information block, the namespaces
   block, and the definitions block.

3.1.  Information block

   The information block contains generic meta data for the file itself
   and all included definitions.  To enable tool integration, the
   information block is optional in the grammar of SDF; most processes
   for working with SDF files will have policies that only SDF models
   with an info block can be processed.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED
   that SDF validator tools emit a warning when no information block is
   found.

   The keyword (map key) that defines an information block is "info".
   Its value is a JSON map in turn, with a set of entries that represent
   qualities that apply to the included definition.

   Qualities of the information block are shown in Table 1.

    |           |        |          | containing license terms        |
    +-----------+--------+----------+---------------------------------+

                Table 1: Qualities of the Information Block

   The version quality is used to indicate version information about the
   set of definitions in the file.  The version is RECOMMENDED to be
   lexicographically increasing over the life of a model: a newer model
   always has a version string that string-compares higher than all
   previous versions.  This is easily achieved by following the
   convention to start the version with an [RFC3339] date-time or, if
   new versions are generated less frequently than once a day, just the
   full-date (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD); in many cases, that will be all that is
   needed (see Figure 1 for an example).  This specification does not
   give a strict definition for the format of the version string but
   each using system or organization should define internal structure
   and semantics to the level needed for their use.  If no further
   details are provided, a date-time or full-date in this field can be
   assumed to indicate the latest update time of the definitions in the
   file.

   The license string is preferably either a URI that points to a web
   page with an unambiguous definition of the license, or an [SPDX]
   license identifier.  (For models to be handled by the One Data Model
   liaison group, this will typically be "BSD-3-Clause".)

3.2.  Namespaces block

   The namespaces block contains the namespace map and the
   defaultNamespace setting.

   The namespace map is a map from short names for URIs to the namespace
   URIs themselves.

   The defaultNamespace setting selects one of the entries in the
   namespace map by giving its short name.  The associated URI (value of
   this entry) becomes the default namespace for the SDF definition
   file.

     +==================+========+==========+=======================+
     | Quality          | Type   | Required | Description           |

     | defaultNamespace | string | no       | Identifies one of the |

     |                  |        |          | used as a default in  |
     |                  |        |          | resolving identifiers |
     +------------------+--------+----------+-----------------------+

                        Table 2: Namespaces Block

   The following example declares a set of namespaces and defines cap as
   the default namespace.  By convention, the values in the namespace
   map contain full URIs without a fragment identifier, and the fragment
   identifier is then added, if needed, where the namespace entry is
   used.

   "namespace": {
     "cap": "https://example.com/capability/cap",
     "zcl": "https://zcl.example.com/sdf"
   },
   "defaultNamespace": "cap"

   If no defaultNamespace setting is given, the SDF definition file does
   not contribute to a global namespace.  As the defaultNamespace is set
   by giving a namespace short name, its presence requires a namespace
   map that contains a mapping for that namespace short name.

   If no namespace map is given, no short names for namespace URIs are
   set up, and no defaultNamespace can be given.

3.3.  Definitions block

   The Definitions block contains one or more groups, each identified by
   a Class Name Keyword (there can only be one group per keyword; the
   actual grouping is just a shortcut and does not carry any specific
   semantics).  The value of each group is a JSON map (object), the keys
   of which serve for naming the individual definitions in this group,
   and the corresponding values provide a set of qualities (name-value
   pairs) for the individual definition.  (In short, we speak of the map
   entries as "named sets of qualities".)

   Each group may contain zero or more definitions.  Each identifier
   defined creates a new type and term in the target namespace.
   Declarations have a scope of the current definition block.

   A definition may in turn contain other definitions.  Each definition
   is a named set of qualities, i.e., it consists of the newly defined
   identifier and a set of key-value pairs that represent the defined
   qualities and contained definitions.

   An example for an Object definition is given in Figure 3:

   "sdfObject": {
     "foo": {
       "sdfProperty": {
         "bar": {
           "type": "boolean"
         }
       }
     }
   }

                    Figure 3: Example Object definition

   This example defines an Object "foo" that is defined in the default
   namespace (full address: #/sdfObject/foo), containing a property that
   can be addressed as #/sdfObject/foo/sdfProperty/bar, with data of
   type boolean.

   Some of the definitions are also declarations: the definition of the
   entry "bar" in the property "foo" means that each instance of a "foo"
   can have zero or one instance of a "bar".  Entries within
   sdfProperty, sdfAction, and sdfEvent, within sdfObject entries, are
   declarations.  Similarly, entries within an sdfThing describe
   instances of sdfObject (or nested sdfThing) that form part of
   instances of the Thing.

4.  Names and namespaces

   SDF definition files may contribute to a global namespace, and may
   reference elements from that global namespace.  (An SDF definition
   file that does not set a defaultNamespace does not contribute to a
   global namespace.)

4.1.  Structure

   Global names look exactly like https:// URIs with attached fragment
   identifiers.

   There is no intention to require that these URIs can be dereferenced.
   (However, as future versions of SDF might find a use for
   dereferencing global names, the URI should be chosen in such a way
   that this may become possible in the future.)

   The absolute URI of a global name should be a URI as per Section 3 of
   [RFC3986], with a scheme of "https" and a path (hier-part in
   [RFC3986]).  For the present version of this specification, the query
   part should not be used (it might be used in later versions).

   The fragment identifier is constructed as per Section 6 of [RFC6901].

4.2.  Contributing global names

   The fragment identifier part of a global name defined in an SDF
   definition file is constructed from a JSON pointer that selects the
   element defined for this name in the SDF definition file.

   The absolute URI part is a copy of the default namespace, i.e., the
   default namespace is always the target namespace for a name for which
   a definition is contributed.  When emphasizing that name definitions
   are contributed to the default namespace, we therefore also call it
   the "target namespace" of the SDF definition file.

   E.g., in Figure 1, definitions for the following global names are
   contributed:

   *  https://example.com/capability/cap#/sdfObject/Switch

   *  https://example.com/capability/cap#/sdfObject/Switch/sdfProperty/
      value

   *  https://example.com/capability/cap#/sdfObject/Switch/sdfAction/on

   *  https://example.com/capability/cap#/sdfObject/Switch/sdfAction/off

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


   Note the #, which separates the absolute-URI part (Section 4.3 of
   [RFC3986]) from the fragment identifier part.

4.3.  Referencing global names

   A name reference takes the form of the production curie in
   [W3C.NOTE-curie-20101216] (note that this excludes the production
   safe-curie), but also limiting the IRIs involved in that production
   to URIs as per [RFC3986] and the prefixes to ASCII characters
   [RFC0020].

   A name that is contributed by the current SDF definition file can be
   referenced by a Same-Document Reference as per Section 4.4 of
   [RFC3986].  As there is little point in referencing the entire SDF
   definition file, this will be a # followed by a JSON pointer.  This
   is the only kind of name reference to itself that is possible in an
   SDF definition file that does not set a default namespace.

   Name references that point outside the current SDF definition file
   need to contain curie prefixes.  These then reference namespace
   declarations in the namespaces block.

   For example, if a namespace prefix is defined:

   "namespace": {
     "foo": "https://example.com/"
   }

   Then this reference to that namespace:

   { "sdfRef": "foo:#/sdfData/temperatureData" }

   references the global name:

   "https://example.com/#/sdfData/temperatureData"

   Note that there is no way to provide a URI scheme name in a curie, so
   all references outside of the document need to go through the
   namespace map.

   Name references occur only in specific elements of the syntax of SDF:

   *  copying elements via sdfRef values

   *  pointing to elements via sdfRequired value elements

4.4.  sdfRef

   In a JSON map establishing a definition, the keyword "sdfRef" is used
   to copy all of the qualities and enclosed definitions of the
   referenced definition, indicated by the included name reference, into
   the newly formed definition.  (This can be compared to the processing
   of the "$ref" keyword in [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01].)

   For example, this reference:

   "temperatureProperty": {
     "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/temperatureData"
   }

   creates a new definition "temperatureProperty" that contains all of
   the qualities defined in the definition at /sdfData/temperatureData.

   The sdfRef member need not be the only member of a map.  Additional
   members may be present with the intention to override parts of the
   referenced map or to add new qualities or definitions.

   When processing sdfRef, if the target definition contains also sdfRef
   (i.e., is based on yet another definition), that MUST be processed as
   well.

   More formally, for a JSON map that contains an sdfRef member, the
   semantics is defined to be as if the following steps were performed:

   1.  The JSON map that contains the sdfRef member is copied into a
       variable named "patch".

   2.  The sdfRef member of the copy in "patch" is removed.

   3.  the JSON pointer that is the value of the sdfRef member is
       dereferenced and the result is copied into a variable named
       "original".

   4.  The JSON Merge Patch algorithm [RFC7396] is applied to patch the
       contents of "original" with the contents of "patch".

   5.  The result of the Merge Patch is used in place of the value of
       the original JSON map.

   TODO: Make sure that the grammar in Appendix A allows specifying the
   null values that are necessary to remove members in a merge-patch.

4.4.1.  Resolved models

   A model where all sdfRef references are processed as described in
   Section 4.4 is called a resolved model.

   For example, given the following sdfData definitions:

   "sdfData": {
     "Coordinate" : {
       "type": "number", "unit": "m"
     },
     "X-Coordinate" : {
       "sdfRef" : "#/sdfData/Coordinate",
       "description": "Distance from the base of the Thing along the X axis."
     },
     "Non-neg-X-Coordinate" : {
       "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/X-Coordinate",
       "minimum": 0
     }
   }

   After resolving the definitions would look as follows:

   "sdfData": {
     "Coordinate" : {
       "type": "number", "unit": "m"
     },
     "X-Coordinate" : {
       "description": "Distance from the base of the Thing along the X axis.",
       "type": "number", "unit": "m"
     },
     "Non-neg-X-Coordinate" : {
       "description": "Distance from the base of the Thing along the X axis.",
       "minimum": 0, "type": "number", "unit": "m"
     }
   }

4.5.  sdfRequired

   The keyword "sdfRequired" is provided to apply a constraint that
   defines for which declarations corresponding data are mandatory in an
   instance conforming the current definition.

   The value of "sdfRequired" is an array of name references (JSON
   pointers), each indicating one declaration that is mandatory to be
   represented.

   The example in Figure 4 shows two required elements in the sdfObject
   definition for "temperatureWithAlarm", the sdfProperty
   "currentTemperature", and the sdfEvent "overTemperatureEvent".  The
   example also shows the use of JSON pointer with "sdfRef" to use a
   pre-existing definition in this definition, for the "alarmType" data
   (sdfOutputData) produced by the sdfEvent "overTemperatureEvent".

   {
     "sdfObject": {
       "temperatureWithAlarm": {
         "sdfRequired": [

4.6.  Common Qualities

   Definitions in SDF share a number of qualities that provide metadata
   for them.  These are listed in Table 3.  None of these qualities are
   required or have default values that are assumed if the quality is
   absent.  If a label is required for an application and no label is
   given in the SDF model, the last part (reference-token, Section 3 of
   [RFC6901]) of the JSON pointer to the definition can be used.

4.7.  Data Qualities

   Data qualities are used in sdfData and sdfProperty definitions, which
   are named sets of data qualities (abbreviated as named-sdq).

   Appendix C lists data qualities inspired by the various proposals at
   json-schema.org; the intention is that these (information model
   level) qualities are compatible with the (data model) semantics from
   the versions of the json-schema.org proposal they were imported from.

   Table 4 lists data qualities defined specifically for the present
   specification.

                 Table 4: SDF-defined Qualities of sdfData

   1.  Note that the quality unit was called units in SDF 1.0.  The unit
       name SHOULD be as per the SenML Units Registry or the Secondary
       Units Registry in [IANA.senml] as specified by Sections 4.5.1 and
       12.1 of [RFC8428] and Section 3 of [RFC8798], respectively.

       Exceptionally, if a registration in these registries cannot be
       obtained or would be inappropriate, the unit name can also be a
       URI that is pointing to a definition of the unit.  Note that SDF

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


       processors are not expected to (and normally SHOULD NOT)
       dereference these URIs; they may be useful to humans, though.  A
       URI unit name is distinguished from a registered unit name by the
       presence of a colon; registered unit names that contain a colon
       (at the time of writing, none) can therefore not be used in SDF.

       For use by translators into ecosystems that require URIs for unit
       names, the URN sub-namespace "urn:ietf:params:unit" is provided
       (Section 7.2); URNs from this sub-namespace MUST NOT be used in a
       unit quality, in favor of simply notating the unit name (e.g., kg
       instead of urn:ietf:params:unit:kg).

   2.  these qualities were included in SDF 1.0, but were not fully
       defined; they are not included in SDF 1.1.  In 1.next, they will
       be replaced by qualities to express scaling that are more aligned
       with the processes that combine ecosystem and instance specific
       information with an SDF model.

   3.  The contentFormat quality follows the Content-Format-Spec as
       defined in Section 6 of [RFC9193], allowing for expressing both
       numeric and string based Content-Formats.

4.7.1.  sdfType

   SDF defines a number of basic types beyond those provided by JSON or
   JSO.  These types are identified by the sdfType quality, which is a
   text string from a set of type names defined by SDF.

   To aid interworking with [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01]
   implementations, it is RECOMMENDED that sdfType is always used in
   conjunction with the type quality inherited from
   [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01], in such a way as to yield a
   common representation of the type's values in JSON.

   Values for sdfType that are defined in SDF 1.1 are shown in Table 5.
   This table also gives a description of the semantics of the sdfType,
   the conventional value for type to be used with the sdfType value,
   and a conventional JSON representation for values of the type.

     +-------------+-------------+--------+--------------------------+

           Table 5: Values defined in SDF 1.1 for sdfType quality

   (1) Note that the definition of unix-time does not imply the
   capability to represent points in time that fall on leap seconds.
   More date/time-related sdfTypes are likely to be added in future
   versions of this specification.

   In SDF 1.0, a similar concept was called subtype.

4.7.2.  sdfChoice

   Data can be a choice of named alternatives, called sdfChoice.  Each
   alternative is identified by a name (string, key in the JSON object
   used to represent the choice) and a set of dataqualities (object, the
   value in the JSON object used to represent the choice).
   Dataqualities that are specified at the same level as the sdfChoice
   apply to all choices in the sdfChoice, except those specific choices
   where the dataquality is overridden at the choice level.

   sdfChoice merges the functions of two constructs found in
   [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01]:

   *  enum

      What would have been

      "enum": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

      in SDF 1.0, is often best represented as:

      "sdfChoice": {
        "foo": { "description": "This is a foonly"},
        "bar": { "description": "As defined in the second world congress"},
        "baz": { "description": "From zigbee foobaz"}
      }

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


      This allows the placement of other dataqualities such as
      description in the example.

      If an enum needs to use a data type different from text string,
      e.g. what would have been

      "type": "number",
      "enum": [1, 2, 3]

      in SDF 1.0, is represented as:

      "type": "number",
      "sdfChoice": {
        "a-better-name-for-alternative-1": { "const": 1 },
        "alternative-2": { "const": 2 },
        "the-third-alternative": { "const": 3 }
      }

      where the string names obviously would be chosen in a way that is
      descriptive for what these numbers actually stand for; sdfChoice
      also makes it easy to add number ranges into the mix.

      (Note that const can also be used for strings as in the previous
      example, e.g., if the actual string value is indeed a crucial
      element for the data model.)

   *  anyOf

      [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01] provides a type union
      called anyOf, which provides a choice between anonymous
      alternatives.

      What could have been

      "anyOf": [
        {"type": "array", "minItems": 3, "maxItems": "3", "items": {
           "$ref": "#/sdfData/rgbVal"}},
        {"type": "array", "minItems": 4, "maxItems": "4", "items": {
           "$ref": "#/sdfData/cmykVal"}}
      ]

      in [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01] can be more
      descriptively notated in SDF as:

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


      "sdfChoice": {
        "rgb": {"type": "array", "minItems": 3, "maxItems": "3", "items": {
                  "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/rgbVal"}},
        "cmyk": {"type": "array", "minItems": 4, "maxItems": "4", "items": {
                  "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/cmykVal"}}
      }

   Note that there is no need in SDF for the type intersection construct
   allOf or the peculiar type-xor construct oneOf found in
   [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01].

   As a simplification for readers of SDF specifications accustomed to
   the [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01] enum keyword, this is
   retained, but limited to a choice of text string values, such that

   "enum": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

   is syntactic sugar for

   "sdfChoice": {
     "foo": { "const": "foo"},
     "bar": { "const": "bar"},
     "baz": { "const": "baz"}
   }

5.  Keywords for definition groups

   The following SDF keywords are used to create definition groups in
   the target namespace.  All these definitions share some common
   qualities as discussed in Section 4.6.

5.1.  sdfObject

   The sdfObject keyword denotes a group of zero or more Object
   definitions.  Object definitions may contain or include definitions
   of Properties, Actions, Events declared for the object, as well as
   data types (sdfData group) to be used in this or other Objects.

   The qualities of an sdfObject include the common qualities,
   additional qualities are shown in Table 6.  None of these qualities
   are required or have default values that are assumed if the quality
   is absent.

   The sdfProperty keyword denotes a group of zero or more Property
   definitions.

   Properties are used to model elements of state.

   The qualities of a Property definition include the data qualities
   (and thus the common qualities), see Section 4.7, additional
   qualities are shown in Table 7.

   sdfInputData defines the input data of the action.  sdfOutputData
   defines the output data of the action.  As discussed in
   Section 2.2.3, a set of data qualities with type "object" can be used
   to substructure either data item, with optionality indicated by the
   data quality required.

5.4.  sdfEvent

   The sdfEvent keyword denotes zero or more Event definitions.

   Events are used to model asynchronous occurrences that may be
   communicated proactively.  Events have data elements which are
   communicated upon the occurrence of the event.

   The qualities of sdfEvent include the common qualities, additional
   qualities are shown in Table 9.

                      Table 9: Qualities of sdfEvent

   sdfOutputData defines the output data of the action.  As discussed in
   Section 2.2.4, a set of data qualities with type "object" can be used
   to substructure the output data item, with optionality indicated by
   the data quality required.

5.5.  sdfData

   The sdfData keyword denotes a group of zero or more named data type
   definitions (named-sdq).

   An sdfData definition provides a reusable semantic identifier for a
   type of data item and describes the constraints on the defined type.
   It is not itself a declaration, i.e., it does not cause any of these
   data items to be included in an affordance definition.

Internet-Draft                  OneDM SDF                      June 2022


   The qualities of sdfData include the data qualities (and thus the
   common qualities), see Section 4.7.

6.  High Level Composition

   The requirements for high level composition include the following:

   *  The ability to represent products, standardized product types, and
      modular products while maintaining the atomicity of Objects.

   *  The ability to compose a reusable definition block from Objects,
      for example a single plug unit of an outlet strip with on/off
      control, energy monitor, and optional dimmer objects, while
      retaining the atomicity of the individual objects.

   *  The ability to compose Objects and other definition blocks into a
      higher level thing that represents a product, while retaining the
      atomicity of objects.

   *  The ability to enrich and refine a base definition to have
      product-specific qualities and quality values, e.g. unit, range,
      and scale settings.

   *  The ability to reference items in one part of a complex definition
      from another part of the same definition, for example to summarize
      the energy readings from all plugs in an outlet strip.

6.1.  Paths in the model namespaces

   The model namespace is organized according to terms that are defined
   in the definition files that are present in the namespace.  For
   example, definitions that originate from an organization or vendor
   are expected to be in a namespace that is specific to that
   organization or vendor.  There is expected to be an SDF namespace for
   common SDF definitions used in OneDM.

   The structure of a path in a namespace is defined by the JSON
   Pointers to the definitions in the files in that namespace.  For
   example, if there is a file defining an object "Switch" with an
   action "on", then the reference to the action would be
   "ns:/sdfObject/Switch/sdfAction/on" where ns is the namespace prefix
   (short name for the namespace).

6.2.  Modular Composition

   Modular composition of definitions enables an existing definition
   (could be in the same file or another file) to become part of a new
   definition by including a reference to the existing definition within
   the model namespace.

6.2.1.  Use of the "sdfRef" keyword to re-use a definition

   An existing definition may be used as a template for a new
   definition, that is, a new definition is created in the target
   namespace which uses the defined qualities of some existing
   definition.  This pattern will use the keyword "sdfRef" as a quality
   of a new definition with a value consisting of a reference to the
   existing definition that is to be used as a template.

   In the definition that uses "sdfRef", new qualities may be added and
   existing qualities from the referenced definition may be overridden.
   (Note that JSON maps (objects) do not have a defined order, so the
   SDF processor may see these overrides before seeing the sdfRef.)

   As a convention, overrides are intended to be used only for further
   restricting the set of data values, as shown in Figure 5: any value
   for a cable-length also is a valid value for a length, with the
   additional restriction that the length cannot be smaller than 5 cm.
   (This is labeled as a convention as it cannot be checked in the
   general case; a quality of implementation consideration for a tool
   might be to provide at least some form of checking.)  Note that a
   description is provided that overrides the description of the
   referenced definition; as this quality is intended for human
   consumption there is no conflict with the intended goal.

   "sdfData":
     "length" : {
       "type": "number",
       "minimum": 0,
       "unit": "m"
       "description": "There can be no negative lengths."
     }
   ...
     "cable-length" : {
       "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/length"
       "minimum": 5e-2,
       "description": "Cables must be at least 5 cm."
     }

6.3.  sdfThing

   An sdfThing is a set of declarations and qualities that may be part
   of a more complex model.  For example, the object declarations that
   make up the definition of a single socket of an outlet strip could be
   encapsulated in an sdfThing, and the socket-thing itself could be
   used in a declaration in the sdfThing definition for the outlet strip
   (see Figure 6 in {outlet-strip-example}} for an example SDF model).

   sdfThing definitions carry semantic meaning, such as a defined
   refrigerator compartment and a defined freezer compartment, making up
   a combination refrigerator-freezer product.  An sdfThing can also
   contain Interaction Affordances and sdfData itself, such as a status
   (on/off) for the refrigerator-freezer as a whole (see Figure 7 in
   Appendix D.2 for an example SDF model illustrating these aspects).

   An sdfThing may be composed of sdfObjects and other sdfThings.

   The qualities of sdfThing are shown in Table 10.

Appendix A.  Formal Syntax of SDF

   This appendix describes the syntax of SDF using CDDL [RFC8610].  Note
   that this appendix was derived from Ari Keranen's "alt-schema" and
   Michael Koster's "schema", with a view of covering the syntax that is
   currently in use at the One Data Model playground repository.

   This appendix shows the framework syntax only, i.e., a syntax with
   liberal extension points.  Since this syntax is nearly useless in
   finding typos in an SDF specification, a second syntax, the
   validation syntax, is defined that does not include the extension
   points.  The validation syntax can be generated from the framework
   syntax by leaving out all lines containing the string EXTENSION-
   POINT; as this is trivial, the result is not shown here.

   This appendix makes use of CDDL "features" as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC9165].  A feature named "1.0" is used to indicate parts of the
   syntax being deprecated towards SDF 1.1, and a feature named "1.1" is
   used to indicate new syntax intended for SDF 1.1.  Features whose
   names end in "-ext" indicate extension points for further evolution.

Appendix B.  json-schema.org Rendition of SDF Syntax

   This appendix describes the syntax of SDF defined in Appendix A, but
   using a version of the description techniques advertised on json-
   schema.org [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01].

   The appendix shows both the validation and the framework syntax.
   Since most of the lines are the same between these two files, those
   lines are shown only once, with a leading space, in the form of a
   unified diff.  Lines leading with a - are part of the validation
   syntax, and lines leading with a + are part of the framework syntax.

Appendix C.  Data Qualities inspired by json-schema.org

   Data qualities define data used in SDF affordances at an information
   model level.  A popular way to describe JSON data at a data model
   level is proposed by a number of drafts on json-schema.org (which
   collectively are abbreviated JSO here)); for reference to a popular
   version we will point here to
   [I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation-01].  As the vocabulary used by
   JSO is familiar to many JSON modellers, the present specification
   borrows some of the terms and ports their semantics to the
   information model level needed for SDF.

   The main data quality imported is the "type".  In SDF, this can take
   one of six (text string) values, which are discussed in the following
   subsections (note that the JSO type "null" is not supported as a
   value of this data quality in SDF).

   The additional quality "const" restricts the data to one specific
   value (given as the value of the const quality).

   Similarly, the additional quality "default" provides data that can be
   used in the absence of the data (given as the value of the const
   quality); this is mainly documentary and not very well-defined for
   SDF as no process is defined that would add default values to an
   instance of something.

C.1.  type "number", type "integer"

   The types "number" and "integer" are associated with floating point
   and integer numbers, as they are available in JSON.  A type value of
   integer means that only integer values of JSON numbers can be used
   (note that 10.0 is an integer value, even if it is in a notation that
   would also allow non-zero decimal fractions).

   The additional data qualities "minimum", "maximum",
   "exclusiveMinimum", "exclusiveMaximum" provide number values that
   serve as inclusive/exclusive lower/upper bounds for the number.
   (Note that the Boolean form of "exclusiveMinimum"/"exclusiveMaximum"
   found in earlier JSO drafts is not used.)

   The data quality "multipleOf" gives a positive number that constrains
   the data value to be an integer multiple of the number given.  (Type
   "integer" can also be expressed as a "multipleOf" quality of value 1,
   unless another "multipleOf" quality is present.)

C.2.  type "string"

   The type "string" is associated with Unicode text string values as
   they are available in JSON.

   The length (as measured in characters) can be constrained by the
   additional data qualities "minLength" and "maxLength", which are
   inclusive bounds.  Note that the previous version of the present
   document explained text string length values in bytes, which however
   is not meaningful unless bound to a specific encoding (which could be
   UTF-8, if this unusual behavior is to be restored).

   The data quality "pattern" takes a string value that is interpreted
   as an [ECMA-262] regular expression in Unicode mode that constrain
   the string (note that these are not anchored by default, so unless ^
   and $ anchors are employed, ECMA-262 regular expressions match any
   string that _contains_ a match).  The JSO proposals acknowledge that
   regular expression support is rather diverse in various platforms, so
   the suggestion is to limit them to:

   *  characters;
   *  character classes in square brackets, including ranges; their
      complements;
   *  simple quantifiers *, +, ?, and range quantifiers {n}, {n,m}, and
      {n,};
   *  grouping parentheses;
   *  the choice operator |;
   *  and anchors (beginning-of-input ^ and end-of-input $).

   Note that this subset is somewhat similar to the subset introduced by
   iregexps [I-D.bormann-jsonpath-iregexp], which however are anchored
   regular expressions, and which include certain backslash escapes for
   characters and character classes.

   The additional data quality "format" can take one of the following
   values.  Note that, at an information model level, the presence of
   this data quality changes the type from being a simple text string to
   the abstract meaning of the format given (i.e., the format "date-
   time" is less about the specific syntax employed in [RFC3339] than
   about the usage as an absolute point in civil time).

   *  "date-time", "date", "time": An [RFC3339] date-time, full-date, or
      full-time, respectively.
   *  "uri", "uri-reference": An [RFC3986] URI or URI Reference,
      respectively.
   *  "uuid": An [RFC4122] UUID.

C.3.  type "boolean"

   The type "boolean" can take the values "true" or "false".

C.4.  type "array"

   The type "array" is associated with arrays as they are available in
   JSON.

   The additional quality "items" gives the type that each of the
   elements of the array must match.

   The number of elements in the array can be constrained by the
   additional data qualities "minItems" and "maxItems", which are
   inclusive bounds.

   The additional data quality "uniqueItems" gives a Boolean value that,
   if true, requires the elements to be all different.

C.5.  type "object"

   The type "object" is associated with maps, from strings to values, as
   they are available in JSON ("objects").

   The additional quality "properties" is a map the entries of which
   describe entries in the specified JSON object: The key gives an
   allowable map key for the specified JSON object, and the value is a
   map with a named set of data qualities giving the type for the
   corresponding value in the specified JSON object.

   All entries specified this way are optional, unless they are listed
   in the value of the additional quality "required", which is an array
   of string values that give the key names of required entries.

   Note that the term "properties" as an additional quality for defining
   map entries is unrelated to sdfProperty.

C.6.  Implementation notes

   JSO-based keywords are also used in the specification techniques of a
   number of ecosystems, but some adjustments may be required.

   E.g., [OCF] is based on Swagger 2.0 which appears to be based on
   "draft-4" [I-D.wright-json-schema] (also called draft-5, but
   semantically intended to be equivalent to draft-4).  The
   "exclusiveMinimum" and "exclusiveMaximum" keywords use the Boolean
   form there, so on import to SDF their values have to be replaced by
   the values of the respective "minimum"/"maximum" keyword, which are
   themselves then removed; the reverse transformation applies on
   export.

   TBD: add any useful implementation notes we can find for other
   ecosystems that use JSO.

Appendix D.  Composition Examples

   This appendix contains two examples illustrating different
   composition approaches using the sdfThing quality.
